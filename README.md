# Student Management App

**Application Architecture**

1. Client:

The Client part is composed of the android/ios application as well as the website frontend. The mobile app
gives the user the following capabilities:

1. Log in to the system
2. View the student’s rades in specific course
3. View the announcements from the instructor
4. QR code scanner to mark the presence of the student in the class
5. View the attendance data in each course to indicate how many times the user was absent in the course
6. View and edit user profile
7. Assure that a process successfully was done by QR scanning of generated codes

```
 The mobile app was developed using React Native, since it is a native framework meaning one code will create
an IOS and android App and thus making the application consistent on the 2 operating systems while also
greatly reducing the development time.
```
```
 As for the web frontend, I used React Js for development which is a JavaScript library for building user
interfaces that insures the frontend is optimal for fetching rapidly changing data that needs to be recorded
which very necessary in the project.
```
2. Server:

In order to maintain robustness in our server, I used Node Js-Meteor.
